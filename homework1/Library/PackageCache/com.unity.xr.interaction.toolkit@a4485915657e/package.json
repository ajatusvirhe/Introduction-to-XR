  "description": "A high-level, component-based, interaction system for creating VR and AR experiences. It provides a framework that makes 3D and UI interactions available from Unity input events. The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components, and an Interaction Manager that ties these two types of components together. It also contains components that you can use for locomotion and drawing visuals.",

    "changelog": "### Added\n- Added configurable functionality to `ARContactSpawnTrigger` in the AR Starter Assets sample to block spawning of objects on AR Planes when the active interactor in the associated `XRInteractionGroup` is either hovering or selecting an interactable object. (Backport from 3.2)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue with `TryGetCurveEndPoint` in the `NearFarInteractor`, where Snap Volumes are not checked against the list of valid targets, which may be different when using Target Filters. (Backport from 3.2.1)\n- Fixed an issue with `NearFarInteractor` where it would ignore the `canProcess` property on an `IXRTargetFilter`, allowing it to always process the filter. (Backport from 3.2.1)\n- Fixed an issue in which the `HandMenu` appears unstable or flickers between showing and hiding when it is displayed while the pose of the anchor transform remains near the angle/range in which it was initially triggered to be shown. In order to solve the issue, the controller displaying the menu now has a separate wider range for hiding the menu than the allowable range that triggers the initial display of the menu. (Backport from 3.4.0)"
